# wordle-bot
this is a python bot that can help you solve wordle and runs in the terminal.
It is really simple and uses less than 210 lines of code.
Uses the GNU 3.0 license so you can do basically anything with it.
Asks you questions about what you already know about the word, then tells you all possible answers in an ordered list based off of letter frequencies.
